    <h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center">Charminar</h1>
    <p>The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi river.[4] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest lies the richly ornamented granite Makkah Masjid.[5] It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official "List of Monuments" prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.[6] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words ChƒÅr and Minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the eponymous towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.[5
